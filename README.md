# Library
This project is part of [theOdinProject's Full Stack JavaScript course - JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript). It's a simple web-based library where users can add books to a library, view them as cards, and remove them as needed. The application uses local JavaScript functionality to dynamically update the library display and manage the state of each book (such as marking them as "read").

## Features
- Add a new book to the library by filling out a form with book details (title, author, pages, and read status).
- View each book in a card format that displays its details.
- Mark a book as "read" by ticking a checkbox, which is saved in the state.
- Remove a book from the library, with updates to both the page and the underlying data.

## Adding/Removing a Book
- **Adding a Book**: Users can click the "Add Book" icon to open a dialog form where they can input details for a new book. After submitting the form, the book is added to the library and displayed.
- **Removing a Book**: Each book card has a remove icon. Clicking it removes the book both from the page and the underlying array, ensuring the library is updated.
